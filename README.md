# SortLab — Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web application that visualizes how classical sorting algorithms compare, swap, and rearrange data — one step at a time. Built as a DAA (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) lab project to make abstract time-complexity differences visually observable.

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a web-based application that visualizes the working of classical sorting algorithms through step-by-step, interactive animation — enabling clearer understanding of comparison and swap behaviour, and making abstract time-complexity differences visually observable.

## Features

- **6 sorting algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
- **Step-by-step animation** with color-coded states (comparing, swapping, pivot/reference, sorted)
- **Playback controls**: Play, Pause, Step Forward, Step Backward, Reset
- **Manual array input** — enter your own numbers instead of a random array
- **Adjustable array size and animation speed**
- **Live stats**: comparison count, swap/write count, current step
- **Live console log** — every comparison, swap, and write printed in real time
- **Algorithm detail pages** — description, how-it-works steps, pseudocode, and time/space complexity for each algorithm

## Running Locally

No installation needed — just open `index.html` in any browser. To run it as a proper local server (optional, avoids any relative-path issues):

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000
```
